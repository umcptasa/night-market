Hiya!! Iâ€™m Amber, a junior CS major and your AASU representative this year! Besides procrastinating on my projects, I love doing crossword puzzles, playing âœ¨mobile gamesâœ¨, and feeding myself ðŸ¤ ðŸ¥³. I canâ€™t wait to make this year the best darn back-to-in-person year thereâ€™s ever been and Iâ€™m so excited to hug people again!
