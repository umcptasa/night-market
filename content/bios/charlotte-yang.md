Hello!! I'm Charlotte and I'm a sophomore majoring in Landscape Architecture. I love art (\~including every random hobby/craft you can think of\~), yummy food, playing minecraft :) and animal crossing, and reading... though that may not last. I love meeting new friends and I can't wait to see our TASA fam thrive!
