Hi! My name is Clarissa and I'm a junior double majoring in Physiology & Neurobiology and Psychology. In my free time, I like to take long naps, read, bake, and pet my cat. After a long year at home, I'm super excited for another amazing year of TASA and meeting new people! Feel free to reach out, I love making new friends :)
