Hey! I'm Jason, a beep boop student looking to go into game development because I like to get underpaid. In my free time I love to play poker, edit videos, and have long chats with new people. I'm really excited to be back on campus and am looking forward to meeting up with everyone all around campus, especially YOU!!
