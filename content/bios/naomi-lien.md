Hey! I’m Naomi and I’m studying Graphic Design. Ugh, meaningful design? Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? Guitar? Those things just hit different. I’m serving on Eboard as Public Relations this year and can’t wait to meet you! Definitely reach out (if I don’t already approach you) and you’ll learn a few other of my obsessions soon enough!
