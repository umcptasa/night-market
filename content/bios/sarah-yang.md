Hi guys! I’m a senior Philosophy & Physiology/Neurobiology double major on the premed track. I love food, reading, journaling, and spending time with friends and family. Outside of TASA you can find me around campus giving tours or studying somewhere. I love meeting new people so don’t be afraid to say hi :^))
